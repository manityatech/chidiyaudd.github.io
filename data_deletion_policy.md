## Data Deletion Policy

Our application respects user privacy and data rights. We've implemented a data deletion policy that allows users to delete their data when they no longer want to use our services.

### What data do we collect?

We collect and store data that is necessary for the functioning of the application. This may include user profile information, game progress, scores, and other related data.

### How can a user delete their data?

Users can delete their data by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the Settings page in the application.
2. Click on the 'Delete Data' option.
3. Confirm your decision in the dialog box that appears.

Please note that this action is irreversible. Once the data is deleted, it cannot be recovered.

### What happens when a user deletes their data?

When a user chooses to delete their data:

1. All personal data associated with the user's account is permanently deleted from our databases.
2. Any game progress, scores, or achievements are also deleted and cannot be recovered.
3. The user will be logged out of their account in the application.

### How long does it take to delete the data?

Data deletion is initiated immediately after the user confirms their decision. However, it may take up to 48 hours for the data to be completely removed from all our systems.
